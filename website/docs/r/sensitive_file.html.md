# local_sensitive_file

Generates a local file with the given sensitive content.
The arguments accepted by this resource are marked as
[sensitive](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/sensitive-variables).

~> **Note about resource behaviour**
When working with local files, Terraform will detect the resource
as having been deleted each time a configuration is applied on a new machine
where the file is not present and will generate a diff to re-create it. This
may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations are routinely
applied by many different users or within automation systems.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "local_sensitive_file" "foo" {
    content  = "foo!"
    filename = "${path.module}/foo.bar"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `filename` - (Required) The path to the file that will be created.

  Conflicts with `content` and `source`.

* `source` - (Optional) Path to file to use as source for the one we are creating.
  Conflicts with `content` and `content_base64`.

* `file_permission` - (Optional) Permissions to set for the output file, expressed as string in
