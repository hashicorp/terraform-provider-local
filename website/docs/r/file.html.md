# local_file

Generates a local file with the given content.

~> **Note** When working with local files, Terraform will detect the resource
as having been deleted each time a configuration is applied on a new machine
where the file is not present and will generate a diff to re-create it. This
may cause "noise" in diffs in environments where configurations are routinely
applied by many different users or within automation systems.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "local_file" "foo" {
    content  = "foo!"
    filename = "${path.module}/foo.bar"
}
```

* `content` - (Optional) The content of file to create. Conflicts with `sensitive_content` and `content_base64`.

* `sensitive_content` - (Optional) The content of file to create. Will not be displayed in diffs. Conflicts with `content` and `content_base64`.

* `content_base64` - (Optional) The base64 encoded content of the file to create. Use this when dealing with binary data. Conflicts with `content` and `sensitive_content`.
