from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.

from imports.aws.s3_object import S3Object
from imports.local.data_local_file import DataLocalFile
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        foo = DataLocalFile(self, "foo",
            filename="${path.module}/foo.bar"
        )
        S3Object(self, "shared_zip",
            bucket="my-bucket",
            content=Token.as_string(foo.content),
            key="my-key"

  replaced with the Unicode replacement character.
- `content_base64` (String) Base64 encoded version of the file content (use this when dealing with binary data).
- `content_base64sha256` (String) Base64 encoded SHA256 checksum of file content.
- `content_base64sha512` (String) Base64 encoded SHA512 checksum of file content.
- `content_md5` (String) MD5 checksum of file content.
- `content_sha1` (String) SHA1 checksum of file content.
- `content_sha256` (String) SHA256 checksum of file content.
