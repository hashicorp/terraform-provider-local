# local_sensitive_file (Data Source)

Reads a file that contains sensitive data, from the local filesystem.

The attributes exposed by this data source are marked as
[sensitive](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/sensitive-variables).

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.aws.s3_object import S3Object
from imports.local.data_local_sensitive_file import DataLocalSensitiveFile
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        foo = DataLocalSensitiveFile(self, "foo",
            filename="${path.module}/foo.bar"
        )
        S3Object(self, "shared_zip",
            bucket="my-bucket",
            content=Token.as_string(foo.content),
            key="my-key"
        )
```

- `filename` (String) Path to the file that will be read. The data source will return an error if the file does not exist.

### Read-Only

- `content` (String, Sensitive) Raw content of the file that was read, as UTF-8 encoded string. Files that do not contain UTF-8 text will have invalid UTF-8 sequences in `content`
  replaced with the Unicode replacement character.
- `content_base64` (String, Sensitive) Base64 encoded version of the file content (use this when dealing with binary data).
- `content_base64sha256` (String) Base64 encoded SHA256 checksum of file content.
- `content_base64sha512` (String) Base64 encoded SHA512 checksum of file content.
- `content_md5` (String) MD5 checksum of file content.
- `content_sha1` (String) SHA1 checksum of file content.
- `content_sha256` (String) SHA256 checksum of file content.
- `content_sha512` (String) SHA512 checksum of file content.
- `id` (String) The hexadecimal encoding of the SHA1 checksum of the file content.
